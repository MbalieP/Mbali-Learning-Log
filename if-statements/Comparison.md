# üß† `if` Statements: Python vs Java vs C#

## ‚úÖ Similarities
- All three support `if`, `else if` (or `elif` in Python), and `else`.
- Logical operators like `<`, `>`, `&&`, and `||` are used in conditions.
- Code blocks are executed based on evaluated conditions.

## ‚ú® Notes
- Python uses indentation instead of `{}` for blocks.
- Java and C# are nearly identical in syntax for control flow.
- Python‚Äôs `elif` is equivalent to `else if` in Java/C#.
