# Type Casting: Python vs Java vs C#

## Similarities  
✅ All three languages support both **implicit** and **explicit** type casting.  
✅ Java and C# use `(type)` syntax for manual conversion.  
✅ Python’s built-in functions (`int()`, `float()`) resemble Java’s and C#’s `Convert.ToInt32()`.  

## Differences  
- **Python** is more flexible with implicit conversion, avoiding strict casting rules.  
- **Java** enforces explicit casting for narrowing conversions to prevent data loss.  
- **C#** is stricter but provides safer conversion methods like `Convert.ToInt32()`.
