# Mbali-Learning-Log 🚀📖  

## About This Repository  
Welcome to **Mbali-Learning-Log**, my personal learning journal where I explore programming languages, frameworks, and development concepts.  

Currently, I’m focusing on comparing the fundamentals of **Python**, **Java**, and **C#**, but I’ll be expanding into web development, databases, and advanced programming techniques.  

## What You'll Find Here  
This repository documents key differences, insights, and challenges as I navigate multiple languages and technologies. Topics include:  

### 🖥️ Language Comparisons  
- Syntax differences between Python, Java, and C#  
- Object-oriented programming concepts across the three languages  
- Debugging strategies and best practices  
- Memory management and performance considerations  

### 🌐 Web Development & Frameworks  
- HTML, CSS fundamentals  
- React for dynamic UI development  
- PHP and MySQL for backend and database management  

### 📊 Advanced Programming & Algorithms  
- C++ for systems programming  
- Data structures and algorithm exploration  
- Understanding Java DX and Mango V  

## Why Keep a Learning Journal?
